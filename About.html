			My style of work is best defined as intrecate and detailed; I pride myself on capturing immense detail within every frame, encouraging the audience to explore my photos and discover intimate portrayals of nature and my subjects.
			I let my environment be my stimulus, I am most comfortable exploring in nature, capturing this space through the eye of a silent observer. I tackle painting tasks with a similar level of passion and detail; paying close attention to every stroke to make sure the essence of the subject is fully captured. 
			The detail in my work is purely natural, with the most minimal editing, if any, and only when required to perfect the shot. 
			I strive to keep my work wholesome, inspired by natural beauty, capturing the nature and character of my subject. I hope you enjoy purusing the site, and please do get in touch via the enquiry form to purchase prints, or arrange a shoot. Look forward to hearing from you!
